# Semantic Search using Endee Vector Database

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Semantic Search system built using:

- Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Endee Vector Database
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

The system converts text documents into vector embeddings and stores them in Endee.  
Users can search using natural language queries, and the system retrieves the most semantically similar documents.

---

## How It Works

1. Text documents are converted into embeddings using SentenceTransformer.
2. Embeddings are stored inside Endee vector database.
3. A query is converted into a vector.
4. Endee performs similarity search.
5. The most similar document is returned.
